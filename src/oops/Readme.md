OOPs stands for Object-Oriented Programming system. It is a
programming paradigm in which software design involves
around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. In OOPs,
objects are data fields that have unique attributes and properties.
OOPs focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate
rather than the logic required to manipulate them. That's why large,
complex and actively updated or maintained program is well suited
for OOPs paradigm of programming.

final class => No one extends/implements
sealed => listed classed can extends/implements [use permit]
non-sealed => Everyone can extends/implements
