>>>>> Radix Sort <<<<<
The lower bound for the Comparison based sorting algorithm (Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick-Sort .. etc) is Ω(nLogn), i.e., they cannot do better than nLogn. Counting sort is a linear time sorting algorithm that sort in O(n+k) time when elements are in the range from 1 to k.

What if the elements are in the range from 1 to n2?
We can’t use counting sort because counting sort will take O(n2) which is worse than comparison-based sorting algorithms. Can we sort such an array in linear time?

The idea of Radix Sort is to do digit by digit sort starting from the least significant digit to most significant digit. Radix sort uses counting sort as a subroutine to sort.

> The Radix Sort Algorithm <
Do the following for each digit 'i' where 'i' varies from the least significant digit to the most significant digit. Here we will be sorting the input array using counting sort (or any stable sort) according to the i’th digit.

Example:
Original, unsorted list: 170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66 Sorting by least significant digit (1s place) gives: [*Notice that we keep 802 before 2, because 802 occurred before 2 in the original list, and similarly for pairs 170 & 90 and 45 & 75.] 170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66 Sorting by next digit (10s place) gives: [*Notice that 802 again comes before 2 as 802 comes before 2 in the previous list.] 802, 2, 24, 45, 66, 170, 75, 90 Sorting by the most significant digit (100s place) gives: 2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802
